# Automation / Non-Interactive Approval Mode

Shared rules for handling automated ForgeFlow stage transitions.

## Rule

If the user explicitly includes `--yes`, `--auto-approve`, `--non-interactive`, or says to continue through ForgeFlow stages without further approval, treat that as approval for the current bounded ForgeFlow sequence. Do not pause at the normal stage-boundary y/n prompt; proceed to the next requested ForgeFlow stage after writing the required artifact for the current stage. This only applies inside the stated task scope and never overrides a blocker, failed verification, missing required artifact, or unsafe/destructive action.
